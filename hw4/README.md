# hw4 Mystery Mansion C++

Searches the graph in the adjacency matrix specified in "MysteryMansionCS2303HW3.xlsx". Each node in the graph has information as specified in "MansionRooms.txt". The format
is (id number, name, value). There are options to: search the entire graph, search a specified number of nodes, or search until a specified total value is reached. After the
search is completed the value of each node in the graph and the subtotal of the total node value found in the search at each node is both printed to the terminal and 
stored in a file.

This program has the same functionality as the one for hw3 except it is written in C++ rather than C.

More details can be found in "MysteryMansionCS2303HW4.pdf" and "HW4.pdf".
