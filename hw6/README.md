# hw6 Newsies!

A C++ program that reads data for Newsies from "NewsiesStaff.txt" and data from different assignments from "AssignmentEditorTxt.txt". The program assigns each Newsie to
assignments and solves the following constraint problem.

Constraints:
- No assignment can be assigned to a Newsie who does not work the corresponding type of assignment. e.g. Skye Svenson does Entertainment, Sports, and Humor so must not be assigned a News story
- No Newsie can take on more than three assignments at a time, a priority assignment, an extra assignment, and an emergency assignment.

More details can be found in "NewsiesCS2303HW6-1.pdf".
